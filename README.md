# Concurrency and Threads


## Business Competences (Concurrency/threads)

As a programmer there are problems that can only (realistically) be solved using
concurrency features

Taking advantage of modern multi-kernel CPU requires an understanding of how to program with threads

These lessons will provide the student with the necessary background to use these
features in Java, with all concepts being generalisable to many other languages as well.

## Plan

#### [Day 1](Day1) - Concurrency, Thread, Runnable, basic Synchronization

#### Day 2 - Threads Continued, Producer Consumer, DeadLocks

#### [Day 3](Day3) - Thread Continued, Callables and Futures

#### Day 4-5 - More exercises
